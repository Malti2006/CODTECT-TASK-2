##OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: LINKED LIST IMPLEMENTATION IN C

A linked list in C is a linear data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The last node's pointer is typically NULL, signifying the end of the list. Each node contains two items: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List: Each node only contains a reference to the next node.
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes.
3. Circularly Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.

Components of a Linked List
1. Node: Each element in the linked list.
2. Data: The value stored in each node.
3. Next: A reference to the next node in the sequence.
4. Head: The first node in the linked list.

Operations on a Linked List
1. Insertion: Adding a new node to the linked list.
2. Deletion: Removing a node from the linked list.
3. Traversal: Iterating through the nodes in the linked list.
4. Search: Finding a specific node in the linked list.

To complete my linked list implementation project in C, I likely referred to various online resources and tutorials. Here are some sources:

1. GeeksforGeeks: This website provides me an extensive tutorial on linked lists in C, covering topics like singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
2. Online Tutorials Library: This resource offers a comprehensive C program for implementing linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
3. Programiz: This website provides me a detailed explanation of linked lists, including their representation, types, and applications.
And many Other online resources, such as tutorials, videos, or forums, to gain a deeper understanding of linked lists and their implementation in C.
